# Project Movies

This week we'll be focusing how to make react apps with multiple pages using routes. You'll also learn how to style your site in a new way, with styled components. 
We will round Sprint 3 of this boot camp off by creating your very own movies site. You'll be building your first multi-page React application, and using a fun new API too. 

The goal for this week is to use [themoviedb.org](http://themoviedb.org/)'s API to fetch a list of movies (more on which movies further down), display them on a page, and then link to a movie detail page when you click on the movie.

This time, rather than following designs from a set of images, we'd like you to follow the design which we've created in our example app using the same [API] (https://technigo-movies-project.netlify.app/)
